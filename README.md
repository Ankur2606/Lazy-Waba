## Lazy Waba Built With Screenpipe Template

*A magical automation tool that monitors your chat apps, reads incoming messages, and responds automatically while you nap, making your friends think you're attentive when you're actually watching cat videos.*

### How It Works (Tech Details)
🧐 **Monitors Chats:** Uses ScreenPipe’s OCR to detect new messages in a fixed WhatsApp/Discord window.  
🤖 **AI-Powered Replies:** Searches your `sqlite3` vector DB, runs responses through your AI model, and types them out.  
🎭 **Acts Human:** Messages are sent via pixel-based automation, making it look like you actually typed them.  

### Strict Rules (Because Windows Said So)
🚫 **Only allowed actions:**-> Move mouse, click, type, and press enter.  
📍 **Coordinates matter**-> window must stay fixed.  
⏳ **Timing-sensitive**-> (delay calibration required).  
🔍 **No native element detection**-> pure pixel wizardry.  

### Behind the Scenes (Workflow)
1️⃣ OCR detects a new message.  
2️⃣ Vector DB finds relevant context.  
3️⃣ AI model crafts a response.  
4️⃣ Script types & presses enter.  
5️⃣ You take credit for the thoughtful reply.

**Lazy Waba:** Because automation is better than socializing. 😎
